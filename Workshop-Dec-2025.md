# Humans in an Autonomous and Robotic World

## Exploring and Enabling Human-Machine Partnerships for Sustained Deep-Space Presence including Moon and Mars

**Workshop Dates:**  December 8-9, 2025

**Venue:** Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg Center, 555 Pennsylvania Ave., Washington DC

**Room:**

**Dress Code:** Business casual

**Travel Information:** [here](./Workshop-Travel.html)

## Description

Through the Artemis program, astronauts will return to the Moon in 2028, supporting the American goal of
developing a sustained presence and a thriving lunar economy and continuing onto Mars.
This will thrust humans into a machine world of diverse autonomous systems working in remote and demanding
environment to achieve science, exploration and commercial goals within a complex infrastructure architecture.
There is a critical need for space stakeholders to develop in this envisioned future of operations in a human,
autonomous and robotic ecosystem. A more human-centric and integrated perspective to robotic teaming will
ensure maximal astronaut safety and optimize performance for assured, robust, and faster operations.

## Objective

The workshop objective is to develop a strategic, collaborative roadmap for assured, integrated
human-machine space operations, multi-stakeholder collaborations and consortium, and a technology and
policy research/analysis agenda to accelerate a sustainable human presence in space.

This is an unclassified workshop and no CUI material will be discussed.
